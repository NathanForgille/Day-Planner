# Day-Planner

This is a Work-Day Planner that is routinely updating on the hour. I used moment.js () to power the date and time, and to provide the application with built in understanding. The color code shows when an hour is in the past, present, or future.
Here is a screenshot to display how the planner might look at the end of a work day:

Installation:
-The planner is a simple web-browser-only application. You must open the application using this link: (https://nathanforgille.github.io/Day-Planner/).
This will navigate you to your current web-browser, and deploy the application.

The planner is simple to use:
-Once you deploy the application in your web browser you simply click in the container that you wish to update with a task.
-After entering your task in the time block simply click onn the button marked "save."
-At this point the task will be saved and will continue to persist through page refreshes.
